# CI/CD Pipeline Setup Guide

This document describes the CI/CD pipeline and branch protection setup for the BAFL-Backend repository.

## 🚀 Overview

This repository is configured with a comprehensive CI/CD pipeline that ensures code quality, security, and automated deployments.

### Key Features

- ✅ **Branch Protection**: Main branch is protected - no direct pushes allowed
- ✅ **Automated Testing**: All code is tested before merge
- ✅ **Code Quality Checks**: Linting and formatting validation
- ✅ **Security Scanning**: Automated vulnerability detection
- ✅ **Staging Deployment**: Automatic deployment to staging on PR creation
- ✅ **Integration Tests**: Full endpoint testing on staging environment
- ✅ **Production Deployment**: Automatic deployment to production after merge

## 📋 Development Workflow

### 1. Creating a Pull Request

```bash
# Create a new branch from main
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name

# Make your changes
# ... code changes ...

# Commit and push
git add .
git commit -m "Description of your changes"
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

### 2. Automated CI/CD Process

When you create a pull request, the following happens automatically:

```
1. Code Quality & Linting (Required ✓)
   ├── Black formatting check
   ├── isort import sorting check
   └── Flake8 linting

2. Run Tests - Python 3.12 (Required ✓)
   ├── Unit tests with pytest
   ├── Coverage reporting
   └── Upload coverage to Codecov

3. Security Scanning (Required ✓)
   ├── Safety (dependency vulnerabilities)
   └── Bandit (code security issues)

4. Deploy to Staging (Required ✓)
   ├── Deploy application to staging
   ├── Run smoke tests
   └── Comment PR with staging URL

5. Run Integration Tests (Required ✓)
   └── Test all endpoints on staging environment
```

All checks must pass ✅ before the PR can be merged into main.

### 3. Merging to Main

After all checks pass and the PR is approved:

1. PR is merged into main branch
2. Production deployment automatically triggers
3. Application is deployed to production
4. Smoke tests run on production
5. Deployment notification is sent

## 🛠️ Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.12** (required - latest stable version)
- Anaconda or Miniconda (recommended for environment management)
- Git

### Local Development Setup

**Recommended: Using Conda (Python 3.12)**

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/rkajaria-1507/BAFL-Backend.git
cd BAFL-Backend

# Create and activate conda environment
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate bafl-backend

# Verify Python version
python --version  # Should show 3.12.x

# Run tests
pytest tests/

# Run linting
black --check .
isort --check-only .
flake8 .
```

**Alternative: Using venv (Python 3.12)**

```bash
# Ensure you have Python 3.12 installed
python3.12 --version

# Create and activate virtual environment
python3.12 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt

# Run tests
pytest tests/
```

**📚 For detailed Conda setup instructions, see [CONDA_SETUP.md](CONDA_SETUP.md)**

## 🔒 Branch Protection Configuration

The main branch is protected with the following rules:

- **No direct pushes** - all changes must go through pull requests
- **Require pull request reviews** - at least 1 approval required
- **Require status checks to pass** - all CI/CD checks must pass
- **Require branches to be up to date** - must be up-to-date with main
- **Require conversation resolution** - all comments must be resolved

For detailed configuration instructions, see [Branch Protection Guide](.github/BRANCH_PROTECTION.md).

## 🧪 Testing

### Running Tests Locally

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run with coverage
pytest --cov=. --cov-report=html

# Run specific test file
pytest tests/test_sample.py

# Run with verbose output
pytest -v
```

### Test Structure

```
tests/
├── __init__.py
├── test_sample.py          # Sample tests (replace with your tests)
└── integration/            # Integration tests (create as needed)
```

## 📦 Deployment

### Staging Deployment

Staging deployment happens automatically when a pull request is created:

```bash
# Deployment is triggered automatically on PR creation
# Manual deployment (if needed):
./scripts/deploy-staging.sh
```

### Production Deployment

Production deployment happens automatically when changes are merged to main:

```bash
# Deployment is triggered automatically on merge
# Manual deployment (if needed):
./scripts/deploy-production.sh
```
